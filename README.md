# Rust Diesel Lab
Taking the Diesel ORM for a spin.

# Quick Start
This repo build a command line app that manipulates a SQLite database.
Try it out:

```
    diesel migration run
    cargo run list
    cargo run populate
    cargo run list
```

# Setup 

Refer to the Diesel documentation: https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started.html

## Install Diesel CLI

```
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite-bundled
```

This installs the Diesel command-line interface with a statically linked SQLite.

If you have a dynamic link library for sqlite3 on your system you can also do this:

```
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

## Set up the database
The name of the database file is defined in the `.env` file.
To set up the database and create a `migrations` folder run this command:

```
    diesel setup
```

## Define the initial DB migration

```
    diesel migration generate create_contracts
```

Now, fill out the data definitions for the `up.sql` and `down.sql` migrations under the `migrations` folder.

## Install the tables

```
    diesel migration run
```

To rebuild the last migration you can run this
```
    diesel migration redo
```


# Code

- `.env` contains the environment settings
- `diesel.toml` is the configuration file for Diesel, it tells Diesel
  to generate the [`schema.rs`](src/schema.rs) file and where to find
  the migration scripts.
- `src`
  - `main.rs` is the entry point.
  - `schema.rs` is generated by Diesel and defines the database schema.
  - `models.rs` is the Rust type definitions for to the database model.


# Notes

## Date and Time
Diesel has a `chrono` feature that enables it to use the Chrono crate
with *e.g.* `NaiveDate` for SQL time types like `DATE`.  This is used
for effective dates on the contracts and framework agreements. See
[`models.rs`](src/models.rs).
